This is my first little Python game. 
I haven't found any kind of Bullshit Bingo version on github or anywhere else before so creating one was the obvious thing to do.
I could say that this is just for fun for me and my classmates, but it also could actually help some to pay more attention. 

I will try to run small little Python projects from time to time to improve my coding skills and feel that this is more fun than doing the another DataCamp course.
